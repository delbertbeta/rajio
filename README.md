## Introduction

Rajio is an anonymous file/text sharing platform on web, focusing on lightweight and easy-deploy.

Just similar to [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/), Rajio gives you a space to upload file or text without login and your privacy. **Rajio will not encrypt your file on the server, which is different from Firefox Send**. After uploading, you can share it with your friends by urls or QRCode.

Rajio generate and storage your identifier token for your uploaded files locally. You can wipe your history and hide yourself by renew a indentifier token. We will not store any data about the relationship between specific people and identifier.

The original intention of rajio is only to find an easy way to transfer a file from my PC to my phones without any other software installed.
